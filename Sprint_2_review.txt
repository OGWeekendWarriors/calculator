Nate-
  Created methods to derive sin, cos, tan functions. Working on implementing csc, sec, cot functions.
Nico-
  Finished creating the framework of the algebra class (issue-6). Implemented functionality for simplifying 
  a simple expression (no variables), and can also solve for a single variable in the presence of only 
  addition and subtraction. Completes Feature 1; User story B; Task001 & Task002

Group decisions-
  1) Jared and Nico discussed that a symbolic parent class should be created. This class' main functionality 
  will be to take in the global equation string and keep track of what symbolic mode will be used on the equation.
  2) Nico will create a test project that all testing for symbolic class functionality will be done.
