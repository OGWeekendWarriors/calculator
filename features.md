Features

1. Adding a calculator mode for the functionality of a symbolic calculator. A symbolic calculator is a calculator that can perform various manipulations on mathematical expressions with variables. A symobolic calculator will manipulate algebraic expressions, performing operations such as simplifying expressions and solving for variables.
  
		A) As a calculator user, I want a symbolic calculator option, so that my results are in a familiar symbolic expression.
  
		B) As a calculator user, I want a symbolic calculator option, so I can solve algebriac expressions.
  
2. The modified program shall have a derivation option in the symbolic calculator mode that can take user given expressions, perform basic derivations (no product, quotient, or chain rule), and display the result to the user.
  
		A) As a calculator user, I want to be able to take the derivatives of expressions.
  
		B) As a calculator user, I want to be able to input the derivative with ease.
  
		C) As a calculator user, I want the result to be outputted in a familiar symbolic expression.

3. The modified program will have a derivation option in the symbolic calculator mode that can take user given expressions, and perform derivations that require chain rule, and display the result to the user.

		A) As a calculator user, I want to be able to take derivatives of expressions that have expressions within them.

4. The modified program shall have an integral option for symbolic expressions in the symbolic calculator mode that can take user input, perform basic indefinite integration (no u-substitution or integration by parts), and display the result to the user.
  
		A) As a calculator user, I want to be able to take integrals of expressions.
  
		B) As a calculator user, I want to be able to input the integral with ease.
  
		C) As a calculator user, I want the result to be outputted in a familiar symbolic expression.
		
5. The modified program will have an integral option for symbolic expressions in the symbolic calculator mode that can take user input, perform indefinite integration that requires u-substitution, and displays the result to the user.

		A) As a calculator user, I want to be able to take integrals of expressions that have expressions within them.
		
6. The modified program shall have a partial fraction decomposition option for symbolic expressions in the symbolic calculator mode that can take user input, perform partial faction decomposition that does not require long division, have repeated roots, or imaginary roots, and dislpay the result to the user.

		A) As a calculator user, I want to be able to take the partial fraction decomposition of an expression.
		
		B) As a calculator user, I want to be able to input the fraction with ease.
		
		C) As a calculator user, I want the result to be outputted in a familiar symbolic expression.

7. The modified program will have a partial fraction decomposition option for symbolic expressions in the symbolic calculator mode that can take user input, perform partial faction decomposition  that has repeated roots, and dislpay the result to the user.

		A) As a calculator user, I want to be able to take the partial fraction decompositions of expressions that have squared or cubed factors
