##Features

1. Adding an option for the functionality for a symbolic calculator. A symbolic calculator is a calculator that takes mathematical expressions and displays them into an easier format. In addition to this, the symobolic calculator will manipulate algebraic expressions, performing operations such as factor, expand and simplify.
  A) As a calculator user, I want a symbolic calculator option so that my expressions are clear and easy to understand.
  B) As a calculator user, I want a symbolic calculator option so that my results are in a familiar symbolic expression.
  
2. The modified program shall have a derivative option for symbolic expressions in the symbolic calculator option that can take user input, perform basic derivations (no product, quotient, or chain rule), and display the result to the user.
  A) As a calculator user, I want to be able to take the derivatives of expressions.
  B) As a calculator user, I want to be able to input the derivative with ease.
  C) As a calculator user, I want the result to be outputted in a familiar symbolic expression.

3. The modified program shall have an integral option for symbolic expressions in the symbolic calculator options that can take user input, perform basic indefinite integration (no u-substitution or integration by parts), and display the result to the user.
  A) As a calculator user, I want to be able to take integrals of expressions.
  B) As a calculator user, I want to be able to input the integral with ease.
  C) As a calculator user, I want the result to be outputted in a familiar symbolic expression.
